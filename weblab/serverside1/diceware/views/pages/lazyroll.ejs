<p>Dicewareâ„¢ is a method for
picking passphrases that uses dice to select words at random from a
special list called the Diceware Word List. Each word in the list is
preceded by a five digit number. All the digits are between one and
six, allowing you to use the outcomes of five dice rolls to select a
word from the list.
